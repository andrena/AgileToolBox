FizzBuzz Demo
===

(Cf. https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/) 

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.

But for multiples of 3 print "Fizz" instead of the number.

For the multiples of 5 print "Buzz".

For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz".
